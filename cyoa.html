It was just an ordinary day for you, a day like any other, until you heard those words. At first whispering across your ear, strangely inflected and sending an odd shiver down your spine, echoing in your mind.
</p>
<p class="narration">
You looked around, trying to figure out where the words came from, only to see the world around begin to rip and tear itself away, as if your reality were nothing more than simple paper. Behind the tattered remains peaked out stars, nebulae, and the universe, the cosmos themselves. As the last tatter faded out of view, something else appeared - directly before you but seeming vast and powerful beyond all possible comprehension.
</p>
<p class="narration">
Not another word is said; not a word is needed. It is all too obvious the difference between you and it, between a mortal and a being that may as well be a god. It moves one hand slowly, directing your attention downward, toward a translucent bubble hanging in the void. Within it you can see a small parcel of land, perhaps the size of a small city. The creature points a hand toward you, extending its index finger.

<p class="god">
"It shall be yours."

<p class="narration">
You raise up your hands, cupping them in front of you and barely realizing that you've done it. You're not certain how you know that's what it wants of you.
<br>
Within your cupped hands, <b>100 colorful baubles</b> appear.
